# 🛒 ShopSense: Cloud Computing for Data Analysis & Recommendation Engine

## Project Overview

**ShopSense** is a comprehensive Cloud Computing for Data Analysis pipeline designed for a modern e-commerce platform. This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for processing large-scale customer data, deriving actionable business intelligence, monitoring real-time transaction streams, and deploying predictive machine learning models.

The system is built entirely on **Apache Spark**, leveraging its structured APIs for batch processing, streaming, and scalable machine learning.

### 🎯 Key Objectives

  * **Data Ingestion:** Robustly load and clean large customer transaction datasets.
  * **Business Intelligence:** Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and execute complex analytical queries to uncover trends in demographics, purchase behavior, and customer loyalty.
  * **Real-Time Analytics:** Process live transaction streams to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and detect anomalies on the fly.
  * **Predictive Modeling:** Train and deploy machine learning models to predict customer behavior (Promo Code usage, Seasonal purchases) and provide personalized product recommendations.
  * **Interactive Deployment:** Serve the insights and models via a user-friendly web application.

-----

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is modularized into five core stages:

1.  **Ingestion Layer:**

      * Loads raw CSV data.
      * Performs schema validation and data quality checks.
      * Reduces feature dimensionality using Correlation Analysis.
      * Persists optimized data in Parquet format.

2.  **Analytics Layer:**

      * **EDA:** Statistical summaries and distribution analysis.
      * **Advanced SQL:** Uses Window Functions, CTEs, and Self-Joins for metrics like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) segmentation and Market Basket Analysis.

3.  **Streaming Layer:**

      * Simulates a real-time transaction feed.
      * Processes streams using Spark Structured Streaming with watermarking and windowed aggregations.
      * Monitors data quality and flags anomalies in real-time.

4.  **Machine Learning Layer:**

      * **Seasonal Predictor:** Random Forest Classifier to predict item purchases based on season and user profile.
      * **Promo Code Estimator:** Classification model to predict the likelihood of promo code usage.
      * **Recommender System:** ALS Collaborative Filtering to recommend novel products to users.

5.  **Application Layer:**

      * **Gradio Web UI:** An interactive dashboard that loads pre-trained models to serve real-time predictions and recommendations to end-users.
